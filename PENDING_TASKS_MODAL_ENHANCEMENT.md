# Pending Tasks Modal Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the Pending Tasks Modal to allow users to mark tasks as complete directly from the modal without navigating away. This implementation includes optimistic UI states, role-based access control, proper error handling, and accessibility features.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Hook: `useCompleteTask` (`src/hooks/useCompleteTask.ts`)
Created a new custom hook for completing tasks manually:

**Features:**
- Uses TanStack Query's `useMutation` for optimistic updates
- Updates task status to 'completed' with progress set to 100%
- Records completion metadata: `completed_at`, `completed_by`, `completion_source: 'manual'`
- Invalidates pending tasks query to trigger automatic refresh
- Shows success/error toasts for user feedback
- Triggers push notifications for task completion events
- Handles errors gracefully with detailed logging

**API:**
```typescript
const { mutate: completeTask, isPending } = useCompleteTask();
completeTask({ taskId, department, userId });
```

### 2. Enhanced Hook: `usePendingTasks` (`src/hooks/usePendingTasks.ts`)
Extended the `GroupedPendingTask` interface to expose additional metadata required for task completion:

**New fields added to task objects:**
- `jobId`: Job ID associated with the task
- `tourId`: Tour ID associated with the task  
- `assignedTo`: User ID the task is assigned to
- `assigneeRole`: Role of the assigned user

These fields enable proper authorization checks and context-aware operations.

### 3. Updated Component: `PendingTasksModal` (`src/components/tasks/PendingTasksModal.tsx`)
Enhanced the modal UI with task completion functionality:

**New Features:**
- Added "Mark Complete" button for each task with CheckCircle icon
- Implemented loading state with spinner during completion ("Completing...")
- Added disabled state to prevent duplicate submissions
- Implemented role-based gating (only management, admin, logistics can complete)
- Added comprehensive ARIA labels for accessibility
- Updated table header to "Actions" column (width: 200px)
- Both "View" and "Complete" buttons now display side-by-side

**State Management:**
- Tracks `completingTaskId` to manage loading state per task
- Uses `canCompleteTask` boolean to control button visibility
- Properly resets state after mutation settles

**Accessibility:**
- ARIA labels for both action buttons: 
  - `aria-label="View details for {taskType} task"`
  - `aria-label="Mark {taskType} task as complete"`

### 4. Integration Points

**Query Invalidation:**
The hook invalidates the `['pending-tasks']` query key, which automatically updates:
- `PendingTasksModal` task list
- `PendingTasksBadge` count
- `useFlatPendingTasks` data (used by `SingleTaskPopup`)

This ensures all UI components stay in sync when a task is completed.

**Push Notifications:**
Completed tasks trigger push notifications with:
```typescript
{
  action: 'broadcast',
  type: 'task.completed',
  task_id: taskId,
  completion_source: 'manual'
}
```

## Role-Based Access Control

**Eligible Roles:**
- `management`
- `admin`
- `logistics`

**Enforcement:**
1. Database view (`pending_tasks_view`) only includes tasks for eligible roles
2. Modal only shows for eligible roles (existing behavior)
3. Complete button only shows when `userRole` is in eligible list
4. Each user can only complete tasks assigned to them (enforced by view)

## User Experience Flow

1. User clicks pending tasks badge in header
2. Modal opens showing all pending tasks grouped by job/tour
3. For each task, user sees:
   - Department, Task Type, Status, Progress, Due Date
   - "View" button (navigates to job/tour details)
   - "Complete" button (marks task as complete)
4. When user clicks "Complete":
   - Button shows loading state with spinner
   - Button is disabled to prevent duplicate clicks
   - On success: Toast notification, task disappears from list, badge count updates
   - On error: Error toast with details, button re-enables

## Error Handling

**Database Errors:**
- Caught and displayed via toast notification
- User can retry the operation
- No partial state changes

**Push Notification Errors:**
- Logged as warnings but don't fail the operation
- Task still completes successfully

**Network Errors:**
- Handled by TanStack Query with automatic retry logic
- Error messages shown to user via toast

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] User can complete task from modal (manual test required)
- [ ] Task disappears from modal after completion
- [ ] Badge count updates correctly
- [ ] Loading state prevents duplicate submissions
- [ ] Success toast appears on completion
- [ ] Error toast appears on failure
- [ ] ARIA labels are present and correct
- [ ] Role gating works (only eligible roles see button)
- [ ] Push notifications are triggered
- [ ] Query invalidation updates all components

## Database Schema

The task completion relies on columns added in migration `20260214000000_add_task_completion_tracking.sql`:

```sql
completed_at: timestamptz
completed_by: uuid (references profiles.id)
completion_source: text ('manual' for UI completions)
```

## Completion Source Values

- `manual` - Task completed via UI (this implementation)
- `auto_pesos_doc` - Auto-completed via Pesos PDF upload
- `auto_consumos_sound_doc` - Auto-completed via sound Consumos PDF
- `auto_consumos_lights_doc` - Auto-completed via lights Consumos PDF
- `auto_consumos_video_doc` - Auto-completed via video Consumos PDF

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)

1. Bulk task completion
2. Undo/revert completion
3. Completion confirmation dialog for critical tasks
4. Task completion notes/comments
5. Activity feed integration showing who completed what

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing pending tasks without completion metadata still work
- Modal still functions for viewing tasks
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Additional fields in interface are non-breaking extensions
