/**
 * Common JavaScript utilities for Stream Deck property inspectors
 * This file contains the Elgato Stream Deck SDK communication layer

// This file is intentionally minimal as the SDK communication
// is handled directly in the property inspector HTML files.

// The main function connectElgatoStreamDeckSocket() is called by
// the Stream Deck software and must be defined in each property inspector.
