# Job Card Navigation Hardening - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation hardens the job card navigation system in `JobCardActions.tsx` to provide robust error handling, comprehensive telemetry, and improved user feedback when navigating to Flex elements.

## Changes Made

### 1. JobCardActions.tsx Enhancements

#### Added `canOpenFlex` State
- Introduced a memoized `canOpenFlex` boolean that determines whether the "Open Flex" button should be enabled
- Checks for:
  - Main element availability for selector dialog
  - Tour folder availability for tourdate jobs
  - Dryhire subfolder existence in `flex_folders` data
  - flexUuid availability as fallback

#### Enhanced Dry-Hire Job Support
- Added dedicated handling for dry-hire jobs in `handleOpenFlex`
- Prioritizes `flex_folders` data with `folder_type='dryhire'` over `useFlexUuid` fallback
- Opens selector dialog when dryhire subfolder is found, allowing users to select expense sheets and documents
- Comprehensive error logging when dryhire elements are missing

#### Improved Error Handling & Telemetry
- Enhanced `handleFlexElementSelect` with detailed console telemetry
- Added structured error logging with timestamps for:
  - Invalid element IDs
  - URL resolution failures
  - Unmapped intents (when no valid URL scheme is found)
  - Anchor navigation failures
- Descriptive toast messages that include element display names when available
- Prevented navigation when validation fails (no about:blank windows)

#### Button State Management
- Disabled "Open Flex" button when no valid element is available
- Added descriptive title attributes for disabled states
- Onclick handler validates `canOpenFlex` before proceeding and shows feedback toast

#### Enhanced Selector Dialog Support
- Updated FlexElementSelectorDialog condition to support dry-hire jobs
- Determines selector main element ID based on job type:
  - Standard jobs: uses mainFlexInfo.elementId
  - Tourdate jobs: resolves tour folder
  - Dryhire jobs: uses dryhire subfolder from flex_folders

### 2. Test Infrastructure Setup

#### Updated vitest.config.ts
- Changed default environment to `node` for faster tests
- Added `environmentMatchGlobs` to use `jsdom` for component tests specifically
- Configured setup file: `src/test/setup.ts`

#### Created src/test/setup.ts
- Conditional setup that only runs DOM-specific mocks in jsdom environment
- Mocks for:
  - `window.matchMedia`
  - `IntersectionObserver`
  - `ResizeObserver`
  - `document.getElementsByTagName` (for CSS injection compatibility)
- Integrates `@testing-library/jest-dom` and cleanup

#### Installed Testing Dependencies
- `@testing-library/react`
- `@testing-library/dom`
- `@testing-library/jest-dom`
- `@testing-library/user-event`
- `jsdom`

### 3. Component Tests (JobCardActions.test.tsx)

Created comprehensive test suite with 22 passing tests covering:

#### Open Flex Button State Tests
- Button disabled when no valid element available
- Button enabled when mainFlexInfo has elementId
- Button enabled when flexUuid is available
- Button disabled while loading

#### Dry-Hire Job Handling Tests
- Button enabled when dryhire folder exists in flex_folders
- Button disabled when dryhire job has no dryhire folder

#### URL Resolution Tests
- Financial document URL generation (fin-doc schema)
- Expense sheet URL generation
- Dryhire subfolder URL generation (simple-element schema)

#### Error Path Tests
- Console telemetry on missing element IDs
- Console telemetry on unmapped intents
- No navigation when URL is null
- No navigation when elementId is empty or whitespace

#### Button Visibility Tests
- Open Flex button visibility when folders created
- Create Flex folders button when folders not created
- Refresh, edit, and delete button visibility

#### Tourdate Job Handling
- Button enabled for tourdate jobs

### 4. Existing Test Compatibility

#### Updated openFlexElement.test.ts
- Added `@vitest-environment jsdom` comment directive
- Ensures test runs in jsdom environment

#### Updated openFlexElementSync.test.ts  
- Added `@vitest-environment jsdom` comment directive
- Moved sonner mock before module imports
- Replaced document mock override with spies to work with jsdom
- Updated all assertions to use spies instead of mock document

## Key Improvements

1. **No About:Blank Windows**: All navigation paths validate element IDs and URLs before creating anchor elements
2. **Comprehensive Telemetry**: Structured console logs with timestamps for debugging and monitoring
3. **User-Friendly Errors**: Descriptive toast messages that include context (element names, job types)
4. **Dry-Hire Support**: Robust handling with fallback logic and specific error messages
5. **Disabled State Feedback**: Users see why buttons are disabled through tooltips and toasts
6. **Intent Detection**: Domain/definition hints properly wired through resolver for accurate URL generation
7. **Test Coverage**: 22 component-level tests ensuring error paths and success paths work correctly

## Testing

All new tests pass successfully:
```
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests  22 passed (22)
```

The implementation ensures that missing IDs or unmapped intents show a toast, emit console telemetry, and skip navigation to avoid about:blank windows, fully addressing the ticket requirements.
