# Flex Selector Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Flex Element Selector feature for JobCardActions, allowing users to select which Flex folder to open when clicking "Open Flex" on job cards.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created

#### `/src/utils/flexMainFolderId.ts`
Helper utilities for resolving the main Flex element ID from job data:

- **`getMainFlexElementIdSync(job)`**: Synchronous extraction from `job.flex_folders` array
  - Prefers `folder_type === 'main_event'`
  - Falls back to `folder_type === 'main'` for legacy data
  - Returns `{ elementId, department }` or `null`

- **`resolveMainFlexElementId(job)`**: Async version with Supabase fallback
  - First checks job's in-memory flex_folders array
  - Falls back to Supabase query when data is missing
  - Gracefully handles errors with console logging

#### `/src/components/flex/FlexElementSelectorDialog.tsx`
Interactive modal dialog for folder selection:

- Fetches available Flex folders (main event + department folders) for a job
- Presents dropdown selector with all available options
- Pre-selects user's department folder when applicable
- Opens selected folder in new tab
- Provides toast feedback for errors

#### `/src/utils/flexMainFolderId.test.ts`
Comprehensive unit test suite with 11 test cases covering:

- Synchronous extraction from job.flex_folders
- Preference for main_event over main folder type
- Fallback to Supabase queries
- Error handling for missing/invalid data
- Exception handling

### 2. Modified Files

#### `/src/components/jobs/cards/JobCardActions.tsx`
Integrated the Flex selector into the existing job card actions:

**Imports:**
- Added `FlexElementSelectorDialog` component
- Added `getMainFlexElementIdSync` helper function

**State:**
- Added `flexSelectorOpen` state for dialog visibility

**Logic:**
- Compute main Flex element ID using `useMemo` with `getMainFlexElementIdSync`
- Updated `handleOpenFlex` to check context:
  - If on project management page AND main element exists → open selector dialog
  - Otherwise → retain existing direct `flexUuid` navigation
- Preserved all existing loading states and toast feedback

**JSX:**
- Added `FlexElementSelectorDialog` component render
- Conditionally rendered only when main element ID exists
- Passes mainElementId, defaultDepartment (from props), and jobId

#### `/docs/flex-folder-workflows.md`
Added comprehensive documentation section covering:

- Overview of the Flex Element Selector feature
- Component descriptions and behavior
- Helper function documentation
- Integration details in JobCardActions
- Loading states and error handling
- Testing coverage

## Behavior

### Project Management Context
When clicking "Open Flex" on a job card in the project management page:

1. Check if main Flex element exists in job data
2. If yes, open FlexElementSelectorDialog
3. Dialog fetches all available folders for the job
4. User selects from dropdown (defaults to their department)
5. Selected folder opens in new tab
6. Dialog closes

### Other Contexts
When clicking "Open Flex" in other contexts (dashboard, department pages):

1. Use existing `useFlexUuid` hook to resolve folder
2. Directly navigate to the primary Flex folder
3. Show appropriate toasts if unavailable

### Loading States
Button remains disabled during:
- Folder state loading
- Folder creation in progress
- Flex UUID resolution

### Error Handling
Toast feedback provided for:
- Main folder resolution failures
- Selector loading errors
- Missing folder availability

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:
```
✓ src/utils/flexMainFolderId.test.ts (11 tests) 11ms
✓ src/components/layout/Layout.test.ts (8 tests) 6ms

Test Files  2 passed (2)
Tests  19 passed (19)
```

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- Jobs without Flex folders fall back to existing behavior
- Non-project-management contexts unchanged
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to APIs or props

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Jobs with no flex_folders**: Returns null, falls back to legacy behavior
2. **Jobs with legacy 'main' folder type**: Recognized and used as fallback
3. **Supabase query failures**: Logged to console, returns null gracefully
4. **Missing department folders**: Dialog shows only available options
5. **Loading states**: Button disabled appropriately with feedback

## Files Changed Summary

**New Files (3):**
- `src/utils/flexMainFolderId.ts`
- `src/components/flex/FlexElementSelectorDialog.tsx`
- `src/utils/flexMainFolderId.test.ts`

**Modified Files (2):**
- `src/components/jobs/cards/JobCardActions.tsx`
- `docs/flex-folder-workflows.md`

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and tested. No further action required unless:
- Additional test coverage is desired (e.g., integration tests)
- UI/UX refinements are requested
- Additional contexts should use the selector dialog
