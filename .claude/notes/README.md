# Session Notes

This directory stores notes from Claude Code sessions. Each file captures decisions, patterns, and lessons learned during a task.

## Naming Convention

Files follow the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-<short-description>.md`

Examples:
- `2025-06-15-auth-refactor.md`
- `2025-06-16-festival-pdf-export.md`

## Purpose

- Maintain institutional memory across Claude sessions
- Track decisions and their rationale
- Capture gotchas and codebase-specific knowledge
- Feed back into CLAUDE.md when patterns are confirmed

## Usage

Run `/update-notes` at the end of any session that produced meaningful changes or discoveries.
