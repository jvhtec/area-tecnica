## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

## Push notifications & offline setup

The web client already registers a production service worker, caches the app shell for offline visits, and exposes enable/disable controls for push notifications. To make the feature work in your own environment:

1. **Generate VAPID keys** using `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys` and store the private key on your backend.
2. **Expose the public key to the client** by adding it to `.env` as `VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` (see `.env.example`).
3. **Implement credentialed endpoints** at `/api/push/subscribe` and `/api/push/unsubscribe` that persist subscriptions for the authenticated user and clean them up when unsubscribing.
4. **Send push payloads** (â‰¤ 4 KB) that follow the schema in `docs/pwa-push-offline-plan.md` whenever relevant events occur. Use the saved VAPID keys when calling `web-push` (or your push service of choice).
5. **Verify service worker delivery** by building the app (`npm run build`), serving the production output (`npm run preview`), and confirming that enabling push in Settings succeeds and produces a persisted subscription on the backend.

Offline support currently covers the core app shell. Expand the cache list in `public/sw.js` or add runtime caching if additional assets or API responses should be available while offline.
