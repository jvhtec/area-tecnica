🗺️ Roadmap

## Q1-Q2 (Jan-Jun): Consolidation Phase

**Focus:** Stability, performance, and technical debt

### Performance & Critical Bugs (Months 1-2)

- Fix Android performance (<2s load time)
- Resolve top 5 critical bugs
- Complete iCal export functionality

### Refactoring & Cleanup (Months 3-4)

**Expected outcome:** Stable, maintainable platform with 0 critical bugs

-----

## Q3 (Jul-Sep): Re-evaluation & Decision

**Evaluate 4 options:**

**A) Maintenance mode only**

- Critical bugs only
- No new features
- Minimal time investment

**B) Selective feature development**

- Pick 2-3 high-impact features from original roadmap
- Strict scope control
- Solo sustainable

**C) Team expansion**

- Hire 1 developer
- Knowledge transfer
- Resume roadmap with support

**D) Partial SaaS migration**

- Identify modules to replace
- Begin transition plan
- Reduce maintenance burden

**Decision deadline:** End of Q3

-----

## Q4 (Oct-Dec): Execute Decision

Depends on Q3 decision:

### If A (Maintenance):

- Bug fixes only

### If B (Selective):

- 2-3 prioritized features:
  - Travel & hotel booking integration?
  - Internal chat by project?
  - Advanced permissions?

### If C (Team):

- Onboarding new developer
- Knowledge transfer
- Begin distributed development

### If D (Migration):

- Start SaaS transition
- Parallel systems
- User training

-----

## Key Metrics to Track

**Performance:**

- Android load time: < 2s ✓/✗
- Error rate: < 1% ✓/✗
- Uptime: > 99.5% ✓/✗

**Usage:**

- Weekly active users
- Feature adoption rates
- Support ticket volume

**Sustainability:**

- Monthly maintenance hours
- Critical bugs backlog

## Non-Goals for 2026

✗ Full original roadmap  
✗ 10+ new features  
✗ QR equipment scanning  
✗ Truck load optimization  
✗ AI route optimization  
✗ Provider portal

**Reality:** Without additional resources, ambitious features stay parked.

-----

## Success Criteria (End of 2026)

✓ Platform is faster and more stable  
✓ Android performance is excellent  
✓ Another developer could take over  
✓ Clear path forward exists  
✓ Sustainable workload established
