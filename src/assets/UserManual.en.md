This manual explains **how to use Área Técnica** day to day.

> Tip: bookmark **/manual** and use the search box on the left.

## Quick start

1. **Log in** with your company account.
2. Go to **Dashboard** to see upcoming work.
3. Open a **Job** to check info, documents, staff and tasks.
4. If you work on tours, use **Tours** to manage tour-level docs.

## Roles and what you can do

Access depends on your **role** (and sometimes your **department**).

- **admin**: full access.
- **management**: manages planning/assignments and most tools.
- **logistics**: logistics workflows (jobs, docs, expenses, etc.).
- **house_tech**: internal technician with extended access.
- **technician**: assigned work only (mobile view + job details).

If you don’t see a page, it’s probably **not enabled for your role**.

## Navigation basics

- **Dashboard**: overview and entrypoint.
- **Tours**: tour calendar + tour documents.
- **Festival Management**: festivals by job.
- **Hoja de Ruta**: the day sheet generator / PDF.
- **Timesheets**: worked days and confirmations.
- **Tools**: technical calculators and internal utilities.

## Jobs (the core object)

A **Job** represents a show/day/task unit. From a Job you can:

- check **time and location**
- see **staff**
- open **job documents**
- access **tour documents** (when the job belongs to a tour)

## Tour documents (visibility + technician access)

Tours can have documents uploaded at tour level.

- Managers can mark each document as **Visible to technicians**.
- Technicians will **only** see documents marked as visible.
- Technicians can access tour docs from:
  - **Tours → documents**, and
  - **Job details → Docs → “Tour documents”** (when the job is part of a tour)

## Hoja de Ruta (day sheet) + PDF

1. Open a Job / festival.
2. Fill in contacts, staff, travel and program.
3. Save.
4. Generate the **PDF**.

## Timesheets

Timesheets are the canonical source of **which days a technician works**.

- If you are a technician, your future assigned days control what appears in **My Tours**.
- If you stop having upcoming worked days, a tour may disappear from your list.

## Pending Tasks

Some flows create pending tasks / approvals. When you see a badge or a modal:

- open the task
- read the context
- complete / approve as needed

## Technical tools

Área Técnica includes internal tools (weights, power, stage plot, etc.). Access depends on role.

## Troubleshooting

- **I can’t see a page** → role/department permissions.
- **A tour document is missing** → it might not be marked *Visible to technicians*.
- **Something looks stale** → refresh the page; the app also refreshes automatically.
