# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on setting up the initial project structure and core functionalities, including authentication, dashboard, and basic equipment management features. The goal is to establish a solid foundation for the application that can be built upon in future iterations.

## Recent Changes
1. **Project Initialization**: Set up the initial project structure using Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
2. **Authentication Implementation**: Implemented user authentication using Supabase, including registration, login, and session management.
3. **Dashboard Development**: Developed the central dashboard for users to view and manage their projects and tasks.
4. **Basic Equipment Management**: Added basic features for managing sound, lights, and video equipment, including settings and configurations.

## Next Steps
1. **Enhance Equipment Management**: Expand the equipment management features to include more detailed settings, configurations, and maintenance schedules.
2. **Project Management Features**: Implement additional project management features, such as task assignment, progress tracking, and resource allocation.
3. **Festival Management**: Develop dedicated tools for managing festivals, including artist requirements forms, gear management, and scheduling.
4. **Testing and Optimization**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the reliability and performance of the application, and optimize as needed.
5. **Deployment**: Prepare the application for deployment and set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Technology Stack**: Continue using Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and Supabase for the backend.
2. **Authentication**: Use Supabase for secure and scalable user authentication.
3. **State Management**: Use React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
4. **Routing**: Use React Router for client-side routing to ensure a smooth user experience.
5. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS for consistent and responsive design.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Maintain a component-based architecture to promote code reuse, modularity, and maintainability.
2. **Provider Pattern**: Use the provider pattern for managing global state and context, such as authentication and theme management.
3. **Hooks**: Use React hooks for managing state and side effects within functional components.
4. **Container-Presenter Pattern**: Follow the container-presenter pattern to separate data fetching and business logic from UI rendering.

## Learnings and Project Insights
1. **Efficient Development**: Vite provides a fast development experience with hot module replacement and instant preview.
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript helps catch errors early and improves code quality and maintainability.
3. **Scalable Authentication**: Supabase offers a scalable and secure solution for user authentication and database management.
4. **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS enables rapid development of responsive and consistent user interfaces.
5. **Real-Time Data**: React Query provides efficient data fetching and synchronization, ensuring a smooth user experience.
