# Progress

## What Works
1. **Project Initialization**: The initial project structure is set up using Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
2. **Authentication**: User authentication is implemented using Supabase, including registration, login, and session management.
3. **Dashboard**: The central dashboard for users to view and manage their projects and tasks is developed.
4. **Basic Equipment Management**: Basic features for managing sound, lights, and video equipment, including settings and configurations, are implemented.

## What's Left to Build
1. **Enhanced Equipment Management**: Expand the equipment management features to include more detailed settings, configurations, and maintenance schedules.
2. **Project Management Features**: Implement additional project management features, such as task assignment, progress tracking, and resource allocation.
3. **Festival Management**: Develop dedicated tools for managing festivals, including artist requirements forms, gear management, and scheduling.
4. **Testing and Optimization**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the reliability and performance of the application, and optimize as needed.
5. **Deployment**: Prepare the application for deployment and set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## Current Status
The current status of the project is that the core functionalities, including authentication, dashboard, and basic equipment management, are implemented and working as expected. The focus is now on enhancing these features and adding new functionalities to meet the project requirements.

## Known Issues
1. **Performance**: The application needs performance improvements, particularly in data fetching and rendering.
2. **UI/UX**: Some UI/UX improvements are needed to enhance the user experience.
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing is required to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. **Technology Stack**: The decision to use Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and Supabase for the backend, has been confirmed and is being followed.
2. **Authentication**: Supabase is being used for secure and scalable user authentication.
3. **State Management**: React Query is being used for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
4. **Routing**: React Router is being used for client-side routing to ensure a smooth user experience.
5. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is being used for consistent and responsive design.
