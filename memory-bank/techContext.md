# Tech Context

## Technologies Used
1. **Frontend**:
   - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
   - **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
   - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
   - **React Router**: A library for routing in React applications.
   - **React Query**: A data-fetching library for React that provides hooks for fetching, caching, and synchronizing server state.

2. **Backend**:
   - **Supabase**: An open-source Firebase alternative that provides a backend-as-a-service with features like authentication, database, and storage.

3. **Build Tools**:
   - **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
   - **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
   - **TypeScript ESLint**: ESLint rules for TypeScript.

4. **Other Libraries**:
   - **Radix UI**: A set of accessible, primitive UI components for building high-quality design systems and web applications.
   - **JSPDF**: A library for generating PDFs in JavaScript.
   - **date-fns**: A modern JavaScript date utility library.
   - **Recharts**: A composable charting library built on React components.

## Development Setup
1. **Node.js & npm**: Required for running the development server and managing dependencies.
2. **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes in the codebase.
3. **VSCode**: Recommended IDE for development, with extensions for TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS.
4. **Supabase CLI**: Command-line interface for managing Supabase projects and databases.

## Technical Constraints
1. **Browser Compatibility**: The application should be compatible with modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
2. **Performance**: The application should be optimized for performance, with fast load times and minimal resource usage.
3. **Security**: The application should follow best practices for security, including secure authentication, data encryption, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.

## Dependencies
- **Production Dependencies**:
  - React, React DOM, React Router, React Query, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, JSPDF, date-fns, Recharts, etc.
- **Development Dependencies**:
  - Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, TypeScript ESLint, Supabase CLI, etc.

## Tool Usage Patterns
1. **Version Control**: Use Git for version control, with a branching strategy that includes feature branches, a development branch, and a main branch.
2. **Code Quality**: Use ESLint and TypeScript ESLint to enforce code quality and consistency.
3. **Testing**: Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.
4. **Deployment**: Use continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
