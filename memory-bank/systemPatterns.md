# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The Sector Pro application follows a modular architecture, with a clear separation of concerns between different components and layers. The architecture is designed to be scalable and maintainable, allowing for easy addition of new features and integration of third-party services.

### Key Components
1. **Frontend**: Built with React, the frontend provides a responsive and interactive user interface. It includes various pages and components for different functionalities, such as authentication, dashboard, sound management, lights management, video management, and project management.
2. **Backend**: The backend is responsible for handling data storage, authentication, and business logic. It uses Supabase for database management and authentication.
3. **Routing**: React Router is used for client-side routing, allowing for a single-page application experience with smooth navigation between different views.
4. **State Management**: React Query is used for server-state management, providing efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
5. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a utility-first approach to CSS that allows for rapid development and consistent design.

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Technology Stack**: The project uses Vite for fast development and build processes, TypeScript for type safety, React for building the user interface, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
2. **Authentication**: Supabase is used for authentication, providing secure and scalable user management.
3. **Data Fetching**: React Query is used for data fetching, caching, and synchronization, ensuring efficient and reliable data management.
4. **Routing**: React Router is used for client-side routing, allowing for a smooth and seamless user experience.
5. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a utility-first approach to CSS that allows for rapid development and consistent design.

## Design Patterns
1. **Component-Based Architecture**: The application follows a component-based architecture, with reusable components for different functionalities. This promotes code reuse, modularity, and maintainability.
2. **Provider Pattern**: The application uses the provider pattern to manage global state and context, such as authentication and theme management.
3. **Hooks**: React hooks are used for managing state and side effects within functional components, promoting a more functional and declarative approach to component logic.
4. **Container-Presenter Pattern**: The application follows the container-presenter pattern, with container components responsible for data fetching and business logic, and presenter components responsible for rendering the UI.

## Component Relationships
1. **App Component**: The main component that sets up the routing, providers, and layout for the application.
2. **Layout Component**: A layout component that provides a consistent structure for different pages, including a header, sidebar, and main content area.
3. **Page Components**: Various page components for different functionalities, such as authentication, dashboard, sound management, lights management, video management, and project management.
4. **UI Components**: Reusable UI components for different functionalities, such as forms, tables, and modals.
5. **Hooks**: Custom hooks for managing state and side effects within functional components.

## Critical Implementation Paths
1. **Authentication Flow**: The authentication flow involves user registration, login, and session management using Supabase.
2. **Data Fetching**: Data fetching is handled using React Query, with efficient caching and synchronization to ensure a smooth user experience.
3. **Routing**: Client-side routing is handled using React Router, with smooth navigation between different views.
4. **Styling**: Styling is handled using Tailwind CSS, with a utility-first approach to CSS that allows for rapid development and consistent design.
5. **State Management**: Global state management is handled using the provider pattern, with context providers for authentication and theme management.
