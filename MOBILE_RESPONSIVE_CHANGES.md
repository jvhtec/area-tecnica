# Mobile-Responsive Redesign for Project Management Surface

## Overview
This update implements a comprehensive mobile-responsive redesign for the Project Management surface, following mobile-first design principles and reusing existing mobile layout patterns from the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. ProjectManagement.tsx (Main Page)
**File:** `src/pages/ProjectManagement.tsx`

- Added `useIsMobile()` hook for responsive behavior detection
- Implemented mobile-first padding and spacing: `px-3 py-4` on mobile vs `px-4 py-6` on desktop
- Created collapsible filter panel using Sheet component for <md viewports
- Filters (JobTypeFilter, StatusFilter, Auto-Complete button) are:
  - Shown inline on desktop
  - Collapsed into a Sheet (bottom slide-up panel) on mobile with filter count badge
- Search input adapts to full width on mobile
- Header elements stack vertically on mobile, remain horizontal on desktop
- Added filter count indicator on mobile Sheet trigger button

### 2. MonthNavigation Component
**File:** `src/components/project-management/MonthNavigation.tsx`

- Added `useIsMobile()` hook for responsive styling
- Buttons condensed on mobile: icon-only with minimal padding (`px-2 min-w-[2.5rem]`)
- Month label shortened on mobile: "MMM yyyy" instead of "MMMM yyyy"
- Reduced spacing: `mb-4` on mobile vs `mb-6` on desktop
- Text size adjusted: `text-base` on mobile vs `text-lg` on desktop

### 3. DepartmentTabs Component
**File:** `src/components/project-management/DepartmentTabs.tsx`

- Added `useIsMobile()` hook
- TabsList made full-width on mobile with equal column distribution
- Tab text size reduced to `text-xs sm:text-sm` on mobile
- Reduced spacing between tabs and content: `mt-3` on mobile vs `mt-4` on desktop
- Job card spacing reduced: `space-y-3` on mobile vs `space-y-4` on desktop
- Loading and empty states have consistent padding

### 4. JobTypeFilter & StatusFilter Components
**Files:** 
- `src/components/project-management/JobTypeFilter.tsx`
- `src/components/project-management/StatusFilter.tsx`

- Added `useIsMobile()` hook to both components
- Buttons become full-width on mobile with `justify-between` layout
- Dropdown menus:
  - Align to center on mobile (instead of "end")
  - Width adjusts to `w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]` on mobile for better fit
- Icon and text layout reorganized with flexbox for better mobile rendering

### 5. Dialog Component (Global Enhancement)
**File:** `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`

- Added mobile-friendly scroll behavior: `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto`
- Desktop maintains `md:max-h-[85vh]` for better desktop UX
- Close button given `z-10` to stay above scrollable content
- Ensures all dialogs triggered from job cards are scrollable on mobile

### 6. JobCardHeader Component
**File:** `src/components/jobs/cards/JobCardHeader.tsx`

- Added `useIsMobile()` hook
- Reduced padding on mobile: `p-4` vs `p-6` on desktop
- Condensed metadata and typography:
  - Title: `text-base` on mobile vs `text-lg` on desktop
  - Date format: "MMM d, yy" on mobile vs "MMM d, yyyy" on desktop
  - All secondary text: `text-xs` on mobile
- Reduced gaps between elements on mobile
- Badge sizes reduced to `text-xs` on mobile
- Toggle button smaller: `h-8 w-8` on mobile
- Location name truncated with `line-clamp-2`
- Icons made shrink-0 to prevent distortion

### 7. JobCardActions Component
**File:** `src/components/jobs/cards/JobCardActions.tsx`

- Added `useIsMobile()` hook
- Reduced gap between action buttons: `gap-1` on mobile vs `gap-1.5` on desktop
- Maintained all existing business logic and functionality
- Better wrapping behavior for action buttons on smaller screens

## Design Principles Applied

### Mobile-First Approach
- All components start with mobile styles and progressively enhance for larger screens
- Breakpoint detection using shared `useIsMobile()` hook (md/768px threshold)
- No media queries in JSX - all responsive logic via className utilities

### Safe-Area Awareness
- Container padding respects mobile safe areas
- Sheet components use bottom positioning for thumb-friendly access
- Maintains existing safe-area patterns from Layout component

### Spacing & Stacking Tokens
Following established patterns from MobileNavBar and Layout:
- Mobile padding: `p-3`, `p-4`
- Desktop padding: `p-6`
- Mobile gaps: `gap-1`, `gap-2`, `gap-3`
- Desktop gaps: `gap-2`, `gap-4`
- Mobile spacing: `space-y-3`
- Desktop spacing: `space-y-4`, `space-y-6`

### Touch-Friendly Targets
- Minimum button sizes maintained for touch (44px recommended)
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements
- Full-width buttons on mobile for easier tapping
- Icon-only buttons on mobile to save horizontal space

## Feature Parity

All existing functionality preserved:
- ✅ Job filtering by type and status
- ✅ Job search functionality
- ✅ Department switching (Sound/Lights/Video)
- ✅ Month navigation
- ✅ Auto-complete past jobs
- ✅ Job card actions and interactions
- ✅ Dialog/modal interactions
- ✅ Permission-based UI elements
- ✅ No business logic changes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Viewport Testing**: Test across breakpoints (360px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px+)
2. **Filter Panel**: Verify Sheet opens/closes correctly on mobile
3. **Department Tabs**: Ensure tabs are fully visible and clickable on small screens
4. **Job Cards**: Check all actions are accessible and dialogs scroll properly
5. **Search**: Confirm search works consistently across viewports
6. **Month Navigation**: Test navigation buttons are easily tappable
7. **Touch Gestures**: Verify Sheet can be swiped down to close on touch devices

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with CSS Grid and Flexbox support
- iOS Safari 12+
- Chrome/Edge (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)

## Performance Notes

- No additional bundle size impact
- Uses existing useIsMobile hook (shared across codebase)
- All CSS utilities are from existing Tailwind configuration
- No new dependencies added
